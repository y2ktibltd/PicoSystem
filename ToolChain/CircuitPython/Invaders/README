This is a game for the ÂµGame game console, based on the classic Space Invaders
arcade game.

Note that because of memory requirements, you should copy the game.mpy and not
the game.py file onto the device. This is a compiled version of the same
program, and it takes less memory to load.

Future version will probably be better optimized and will be able to run the
uncompiled version directly, but for now there is this workaround.
